        <h2>Handmade "Jet Black" Coffee Mug</h2>
            <img src="cup2.JPG" width="300">
        <h4>Coffee Mugs: $10.99-$19.99</h4> 
        <p>This piece was handcrafted for one of our customers who asked us to create a unique but classy coffee mug for them.  We molded the handle to the customers hand which created a comfortable form-fit handle that makes grasping the mug effortless. This piece was made on the spin-wheel by one of our Master Potter's and was painted by our ceramic painting specialist.  We believe this is a perfect example of the unique pieces of pottery that we can create for our customers.  A simple pencil drawing from our customer was turned into this one-of-a-kind coffee mug. </p>
        <h2>Handmade "College Colors" Bowl</h2>

        <p>This piece is a perfect gift idea for someone who loves showing off their team's colors. Our ceramic painting specialist can create a design that shows off your favorite high school, college, or pro team's logos and colors.  If you already have the perfect idea about how you want this bowl or plate to look, send us your design and we can flawlessly replicate it for you.</p>

        <h4>Miscellaneous: Prices Vary</h4>
        <p>This ceramic cupcake took multiple methods of pottery to craft and is a perfect example of how special our Master Potter's are. There are very few potters in the world that would be able to flawlessly craft this piece like our Master Potter's were able to do. We are able to create and paint almost any design that our customers can think of and we are confident that there is not another business in the world that can offer the services that we do for the prices we charge. </p>
