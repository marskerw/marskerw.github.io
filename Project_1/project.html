            <h3>Number 1: Baseball</h3>
            <p>I have been playing baseball since I was a young child.  I remember my mom used to throw me wiffle balls in the front yard when I was barely old enough to stand.  My love for baseball has never squandered and I knew since I was a child that it was something that I wanted to do for as long as I could.  My high school baseball team went to the state tournament in back-to-back years, finishing in 4th and 3rd respectively.  My team's success along with the skills I possessed allowed me the opportunity to play at the college level.  I chose to play at Miami University and I have been a member of the team all four years of college, with this being my senior year.

            <h3>Number 2: Fishing</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is fishing.  There is something that I find very relaxing about it and I spend most of my summers out on the lake.  I started fishing when I was very young at my Grandma's lakehouse and ever since then I absolutely love it.  My family owns a lakehouse and I every weekend I try to get up there to relax and fish.  My two favorite fish to fish for are largemouth bass and catfish (below is a catfish I caught two summers ago).  I have had a lot of success catching these fish and look forward to it every summer.

            <h3>Number Three: Miami University</h3>
            <p>Miami University has been my home for the past five years and I have come to love this place.  I have learned so much since I have been here and I know I am well prepared for the future because of it.  I started off my freshman year as a Finance major but as I started to dive a little deeper into the Finance coursework I realized that it did not suit my interests.  I then swtiched to Marketing and picked up an IMS Minor and have loved the classes I have been in for both of these divisions.  It is definitely a bittersweet year because I am excited to see what the future holds but I know that I will miss my days at Miami as I move on.</p>
